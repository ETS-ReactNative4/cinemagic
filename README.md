<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

CINEMAGIC is a system-wide cross-platform mobile application for recommending new movies for the purpose of giving promotion of good movies to users faster based on their preferences by using features and search filters on topics they're interested in. Instead of spending a lot of time searching on each website, this application will help shorten the search time for users. Through customers just need to type in the keywords they want, the application will recommend all related movies from old to new. 

It was created by Digital Design and Development students at BCIT as our final app project.
